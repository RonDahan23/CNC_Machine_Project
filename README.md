# CNC Machine Using 3D Printed Parts

## Description
This project aims to develop a low-cost, versatile CNC machine using 3D-printed parts and open-source software. It integrates concepts from software engineering, electronics, mechanics, and robotics to achieve precise and efficient drawing capabilities.

## Key Features
- **3D Printed Parts**: Utilizes 3D printed components for a cost-effective and customizable structure.
- **HPGL Support**: Accepts HPGL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language) instructions for complex drawings.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting drawing commands and visualizing the output.
- **Real-time Control**: Employs real-time programming techniques for responsive communication between the GUI and hardware components.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Development Environment**: QT Creator, Arduino IDE, and more
- **Hardware**: Arduino R3 microcontroller, stepper motors, encoders, limit switches

## Hardware Design
- **3D Modeling and Printing of Mechanical Components**: Designing and printing the structural parts of the CNC machine.
- **Assembly of the CNC Machine Frame**: Assembling the printed parts to form the CNC machine frame.
- **Integration of Electrical Components**: Integrating motors, encoders, and limit switches into the CNC machine.

## Software Development
- **GUI Development Using QT**: Creating a user-friendly interface for user interaction and drawing visualization.
- **HPGL Parsing and Interpretation**: Converting HPGL instructions into motor commands.
- **Real-time Communication Between GUI and Arduino Microcontroller**: Ensuring responsive communication between the software interface and the hardware components.
