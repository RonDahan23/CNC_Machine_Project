Project: CNC Machine using 3D Printed Parts

Description:
This project aims to develop a low-cost, versatile CNC machine using 3D printed parts and open-source software. It integrates concepts from software engineering, electronics, mechanics, and robotics to achieve precise and efficient drawing capabilities.

Key Features:

3D Printed Parts: Utilizes 3D printed components for a cost-effective and customizable structure.
HPGL Support: Accepts HPGL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language) instructions for complex drawings.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting drawing commands and visualizing the output.
Real-time Control: Employs real-time programming techniques for responsive communication between the GUI and hardware components.
Technologies:

Programming Language: C++
Development Environment: QT Creator, Arduino IDE and more...
Hardware: Arduino R3 microcontroller, stepper motors, encoders, limit switches
Project Structure:

Hardware Design:

3D modeling and printing of mechanical components
